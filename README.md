# Automated_File_Sorter
Development of an Automatic File Sorter for File Explorer

This code helps to organize folders, sorting files by type of document:

  1 - Identify the path of the folder with the documents that you want to sort;
  
  2 - Make a list of each new folder that is going to be created;
  
  3 - Decide where each file extension (i.e., ".pdf") is going to;
  
  4 - Finally, you just need to run the code and it will make the rest for you.
  
 Enjoy ;)
